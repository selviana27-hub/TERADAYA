# Design System Inspired by ElevenLabs

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere

ElevenLabs' website is a study in restrained elegance — a near-white canvas (`#ffffff`, `#f5f6fa`) where typography and subtle shadows do all the heavy lifting. The design feels like a premium audio product brochure: clean, spacious, and confident enough to let the content speak (literally, given ElevenLabs makes voice AI). There's an almost Apple-like quality to the whitespace strategy, now tuned to TeraDaya's logo direction with softened cool tints (`#eef2ff`, `#6f7391`) so the interface stays calm and not overly dominant.

The typography system is built on a fascinating duality: Waldenburg at weight 300 (light) for display headings creates ethereal, whisper-thin titles that feel like sound waves rendered in type — delicate, precise, and surprisingly impactful at large sizes. This light-weight display approach is the design's signature — where most sites use bold headings to grab attention, ElevenLabs uses lightness to create intrigue. Inter handles all body and UI text with workmanlike reliability, using slight positive letter-spacing (0.14px–0.18px) that gives body text an airy, well-spaced quality. WaldenburgFH appears as a bold uppercase variant for specific button labels.

What makes ElevenLabs distinctive is its multi-layered shadow system. Rather than simple box-shadows, elements use complex stacks: inset border-shadows (`rgba(0,0,0,0.075) 0px 0px 0px 0.5px inset`), outline shadows (`rgba(0,0,0,0.06) 0px 0px 0px 1px`), and soft elevation shadows (`rgba(0,0,0,0.04) 0px 4px 4px`) — all at remarkably low opacities. The result is a design where surfaces seem to barely exist, floating just above the page with the lightest possible touch. Pill-shaped buttons (9999px) with cool brand-tinted backgrounds (`rgba(238,242,255,0.84)`) and muted indigo shadows (`rgba(48,66,148,0.06)`) add a tactile, physical quality without overpowering content.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Near-white canvas with cool-neutral undertones (`#f5f6fa`, `#eef2ff`)
- Waldenburg weight 300 (light) for display — ethereal, whisper-thin headings
- Inter with positive letter-spacing (0.14–0.18px) for body — airy readability
- Multi-layered shadow stacks at sub-0.1 opacity — surfaces barely exist
- Pill buttons (9999px) with softened brand-tinted backgrounds
- WaldenburgFH bold uppercase for specific CTA labels
- Indigo shadow tints: `rgba(48, 66, 148, 0.06)` — shadows have color, not just darkness
- Geist Mono / ui-monospace for code snippets

### Principles
- **Light as the hero weight**: Waldenburg at 300 is the defining typographic choice. Where other design systems use bold for impact, ElevenLabs uses lightness — thin strokes that feel like audio waveforms, creating intrigue through restraint.
- **Positive letter-spacing on body**: Inter uses +0.14px to +0.18px tracking across body text, creating an airy, well-spaced reading rhythm that contrasts with the tight display tracking (-0.96px).
- **WaldenburgFH for emphasis**: A bold (700) uppercase variant of Waldenburg appears only in specific CTA button labels with 0.7px letter-spacing — the one place where the type system gets loud.
- **Monospace as ambient**: Geist Mono at relaxed line-height (1.85) for code blocks feels unhurried and readable.

## 5. Layout Principles

### Spacing System
- Base unit: 8px
- Scale: 1px, 3px, 4px, 8px, 9px, 10px, 11px, 12px, 16px, 18px, 20px, 24px, 28px, 32px, 40px

### Grid & Container
- Centered content with generous max-width
- Single-column hero, expanding to feature grids
- Full-width gradient sections for product showcases
- White card grids on light gray backgrounds

### Whitespace Philosophy
- **Apple-like generosity**: Massive vertical spacing between sections creates a premium, unhurried pace. Each section is an exhibit.
- **Cool calm emptiness**: The whitespace stays neutral with softened indigo-lilac undertones and brand shadows to keep the interface tactile but calm.
- **Typography-led rhythm**: The light-weight Waldenburg headings create visual "whispers" that draw the eye through vast white space.

### Border Radius Scale
- Minimal (2px): Small links, inline elements
- Subtle (4px): Nav items, tab panels, tags
- Standard (8px): Small containers
- Comfortable (10px–12px): Medium cards, dropdowns
- Card (16px): Standard cards, articles
- Large (18px–20px): Featured cards, code panels
- Section (24px): Large panels, section containers
- Brand Button (30px): Brand mist CTA
- Pill (9999px): Primary buttons, navigation pills

## 6. Depth & Elevation

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Flat (Level 0) | No shadow | Page background, text blocks |
| Inset Edge (Level 0.5) | `rgba(0,0,0,0.075) 0px 0px 0px 0.5px inset, #fff 0px 0px 0px 0px inset` | Internal border definition |
| Outline Ring (Level 1) | `rgba(0,0,0,0.06) 0px 0px 0px 1px` + `rgba(0,0,0,0.04) 0px 1px 2px` + `rgba(0,0,0,0.04) 0px 2px 4px` | Shadow-as-border for cards |
| Card (Level 2) | `rgba(0,0,0,0.4) 0px 0px 1px, rgba(0,0,0,0.04) 0px 4px 4px` | Button elevation, prominent cards |
| Brand Lift (Level 3) | `rgba(48,66,148,0.06) 0px 6px 16px` | Featured CTAs — brand-tinted |
| Focus (Accessibility) | `var(--tw-ring-offset-shadow)` blue ring | Keyboard focus |

**Shadow Philosophy**: ElevenLabs uses the most refined shadow system of any design system analyzed. Every shadow is at sub-0.1 opacity, many include both outward cast AND inward inset components, and the featured CTA shadows use a muted brand indigo (`rgba(48,66,148,...)`) rather than neutral black. The inset half-pixel borders (`0px 0px 0px 0.5px inset`) create edges so subtle they're felt rather than seen — surfaces define themselves through the lightest possible touch.

## 7. Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use Waldenburg weight 300 for all display headings — the lightness IS the brand
- Apply multi-layer shadows (inset + outline + elevation) at sub-0.1 opacity
- Use brand mist tints (`#eef2ff`, `rgba(238,242,255,0.84)`) for featured elements
- Apply positive letter-spacing (+0.14px to +0.18px) on Inter body text
- Use 9999px radius for primary buttons — pill shape is standard
- Use brand-tinted shadows (`rgba(48,66,148,0.06)`) on featured CTAs
- Keep the page predominantly white with subtle cool-gray section differentiation
- Use WaldenburgFH bold uppercase ONLY for specific CTA button labels

### Don't
- Don't use bold (700) Waldenburg for headings — weight 300 is non-negotiable
- Don't use heavy shadows (>0.1 opacity) — the ethereal quality requires whisper-level depth
- Don't use heavy, saturated borders — keep borders cool and subdued
- Don't skip the inset shadow component — half-pixel inset borders define edges
- Don't apply negative letter-spacing to body text — Inter uses positive tracking
- Don't use sharp corners (<8px) on cards — the generous radius is structural
- Don't introduce highly saturated brand colors — keep hues softened and desaturated
- Don't make buttons opaque and heavy — the translucent brand-mist treatment is the signature

## 8. Responsive Behavior

### Breakpoints
| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Mobile | <1024px | Single column, hamburger nav, stacked sections |
| Desktop | >1024px | Full layout, horizontal nav, multi-column grids |

### Touch Targets
- Pill buttons with generous padding (12px–20px)
- Navigation links at 15px with adequate spacing
- Select dropdowns maintain comfortable sizing

### Collapsing Strategy
- Navigation: horizontal → hamburger at 1024px
- Feature grids: multi-column → stacked
- Hero: maintains centered layout, font scales proportionally
- Gradient sections: full-width maintained, content stacks
- Spacing compresses proportionally

### Image Behavior
- Product screenshots scale responsively
- Gradient backgrounds simplify on mobile
- Audio waveform previews maintain aspect ratio
- Rounded corners maintained across breakpoints

- "Design navigation: white sticky header. Inter 15px weight 500. Black pill CTA right-aligned. Border-bottom: rgba(34,48,97,0.10)."

### Iteration Guide
1. Start with white — the brand undertone comes from soft indigo-lilac shadows and mist surfaces, not heavy backgrounds
2. Waldenburg 300 for headings — never bold, the lightness is the identity
3. Multi-layer shadows: always include inset + outline + elevation at sub-0.1 opacity
4. Positive letter-spacing on Inter body (+0.14px to +0.18px) — the airy reading quality
5. Brand mist CTA is the signature — `rgba(238,242,255,0.84)` with `rgba(48,66,148,0.06)` shadow
6. Pill (9999px) for buttons, generous radius (16px–24px) for cards
